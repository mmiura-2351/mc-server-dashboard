# Minecraft Server Dashboard

A comprehensive management application for Minecraft servers.

## Overview

This project is a complete redesign and reimplementation of an existing Minecraft server management system. The goal is to build a production-ready application with:

- **Multiple server launch strategies** (Host process, Docker-in-Docker, Docker-out-of-Docker)
- **Version management** with rollback capabilities
- **Multi-user support** with role-based access control
- **Automated backups** with configurable retention policies
- **Cross-platform support** (Linux, Windows)

## About This Repository

This repository contains the **reimplementation** of the Minecraft Server Dashboard, designed with improved architecture, maintainability, and extensibility.

### Existing Implementations

The original implementations (which this project replaces) can be found at:

- [Backend API (Python/FastAPI)](https://github.com/mmiura-2351/mc-server-dashboard-api)
- [Frontend UI (Next.js/React)](https://github.com/mmiura-2351/mc-server-dashboard-ui)

This redesign addresses limitations in the original implementation by establishing clear architectural principles and comprehensive documentation before development begins.
